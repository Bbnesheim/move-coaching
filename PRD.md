## 10. Risks & Open Questions
**Key risks**
- **Subscription implementation complexity** – Selected Shopify subscription app may limit flexibility (e.g., upgrades/downgrades, pausing), impacting UX.
- **Payment provider constraints** – Klarna and Vipps availability or terms may affect checkout options.
- **Content readiness** – Delays in final copy, testimonials, before/after photos, and legal text may delay launch.
- **Asset quality & volume** – Insufficient or inconsistent imagery could weaken brand impact.
- **Quiz implementation** – Depending on tool choice, quiz may be limited in logic or styling, affecting perceived quality.
- **Performance regressions** – Overuse of heavy media, apps, or animations (e.g., 3D app animations) could reduce page speed and conversion.

**Open questions (to validate with client/contract)**
- Exact contractual deadlines for design sign-off and launch.
- Final decision on subscription app and its capabilities (pause, upgrade, downgrade, self-service cancellation).
- Confirm exact payment provider setup (which methods for which regions; Klarna/Vipps configuration details).
- Choice of CRM/email platform and required automation flows (welcome series, reminder sequences, etc.).
- Final structure and content strategy for the Blog (if enabled) and frequency of publishing.
- Detailed refund/cancellation policies to be reflected in Legal and FAQ.
- Requirements for multi-language support in future phases.
